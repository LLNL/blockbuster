Blockbuster is a  movie player designed for playing movies in the "Streaming Movie" format on large power walls.  It includes a Sidecar component for controlling the movie player from a remote workstation, and for executing "movie cues" to facilitate one-click execution of a planned series of movie transitions, window placements, and other actions that might occur during a presentation.
