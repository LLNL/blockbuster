-- fixed segfault in smtest when no args are given
-- Use tiling by default in img2sm and smcat

================================================================================
VERSION 2.6.3c
September 24, 2009
-- (r245) by not invalidating cache members so aggressively, got nice responsiveness increase.  This warrants its own release. 

================================================================================
VERSION 2.6.3b
September 22, 2009
-- fixed a regression preventing stereo movies from being stereo
-- reduced Qt widget recursion
-- fixed a couple of bugs in the cache.  One caused crashes when frames were deleted improperly, and one caused hangs when the cache filled with frames that should be deleted.

================================================================================
VERSION 2.6.3a
June 29, 2009
-- Rewrote smlib to remove ALL mutexes and Direct IO technology references.

-- fixed a bug that caused blockbuster to play past the EndFrame in a cue for very short play times. 
-- fixed a bug that caused blockbuster to start on frame 2 of a movie given on the command line
-- hopefully fixed a bug causing the spacebar to not stop a movie promptly 
-- fixed bugs dealing with low frame rates in blockbuster and sidecar.  Now values less than 0.2 are not accepted.  I can imagine for a kiosk you might want slower rates, so add a feature request for "kiosk mode" allowing one frame every n seconds instead of a n frames per second... perhaps some clever notation would work.  
-- fixed a bug causing blockbuster to incorrectly respond to frame numbers in cues and the frame slider in certain instances
-- re-added movie title to blockbuster title bars, lost when the change to Qt occurred.  
-- fixed a problem where sidecar would not exit after playing a movie 
-- fixed a but in cue playback preventing blockbuster from stopping a cue while looping
-- fixed a bug causing a cue to not execute properly if its end frame was 0 and the preceding cue's movie executed past the number of frames than in the current cue's movie (really!)

================================================================================
VERSION 2.6.2a
June 8, 2009
-- DRAMATIC speed increase due to improved network performance and better threading code.  A test movie that was limited to 13 frames per sec is now playing at over 100 FPS. 
-- Switched code repository from CVS to Subversion.  
-- using lzolib 2.03 now to build on new Darwin 9.7.0 kernels (OS X)
-- now add $INSTALL_DIR/lib to rpath, meaning that Qt libs can be shipped with blockbuster for binary releases, greatly reducing difficulty in distributing the code.  This is not done on OS X yet as it broke the build there. 
-- Fixed bug when duplicating cues in sidecar. 
-- Fixed bug setting frame rate in cues.
-- Enabled setting level of detail in movie cues. 
-- Escape key now exits blockbuster, just like the good old days.  'q' still works too!  In sidecar, this has to be shift-Escape because of interface collisions. 
-- Fixed some problems with looping and executing cue sequences. 

================================================================================
VERSION 2.6.1a
May 2009
-- User can now execute and loop over multiple cues in the cue list.  Each cue will execute to its end frame and then the next will execute.  Interrupting the movie also interrupts the cue stack.  
-- Frame Rate stuff:  move FPS back to main control window,  correctly report frame rate setting in GUI at startup, and respect any FPS value in the movie
-- Remove references to "frame" position in GUI and replace it with "Window" for clarity.

-- added ability to start a movie on a remote host from the sidecar command line, and begin playing it immediately (-play and -movie options)
-- simplified the access to stereo.  Simply typing -stereo will use stereo on the back end if you are using DMX and will use stereo on the front end if not.  
-- worked around an apparent Qt bug where old events are spontaneously reappearing from the network completely out of sequence
-- Added dialogs to prompt user to save unsaved changes if windows close or application is quit while working. 
-- Fixed bug that caused interface to be disabled after deleting a cue.

-- Improved error reporting and handling between sidecar and blockbuster, so that for example if a file cannot be found, sidecar reports that error, and not something else it makes up out of frustration
-- Implemented the items in the sidecar File menu
-- Cues now default to full screen to reflect most common current use case

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5g
Sep 4, 2008
-- added -stereo and -dmxstereo flags to blockbuster
-- hide the toolbox on slave nodes. 
-- add -dmx and -movie flags to sidecar
-- fix issues of communication and feedback between blockbuster and sidecar GUIs where changes in one were not clearly reflected or even canceled out by another, especially when playing movies. 
-- add the ability to reset start and end frames in a movie cue to reflect movie length, which was a problem before when you had set the end frame and wanted to change it to something bigger.
-- sidecar interface is a bit smaller
-- added a "pingpong" feature in blockbuster and sidecar that allows movie to play alternately back and forth forever.  This is useful in presenting some scientific simulations. 
-- zoom to 100% now also resizes the window to fit the image

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5f
August 11, 2008
-- bugfix release

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5e
July 24, 2008
-- Added omplete remote control of blockbuster with apparently no hit on performance and excellent user feedback.  
-- Allow capture of start and end frame from blockbuster current frame by clicking "Start Frame" or "End Frame" button
-- fix a few interface bugs in blockbuster and sidecar

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5d
July 9, 2008
-- sidecar can now take a "snapshot" of the current blockbuster state and place the information into the current cue.  So designing a presentation just got easier. Put your movie in the desired state, take a snapshot, then fiddle with details as desired.  Rinse and repeat.  
-- Added zoom field to sidecar cues. 
-- Support a need at ORNL to have idle slaves on some nodes.  So if a slave connects to blockbuster and there is no DMX window for it, the slave is put into "idle mode", where it basically just waits for an exit command, responds to "heartbeats", and doesn't do much else.  
-- Added repeatable test procedure in doc/Testing.txt to ensure more reliable deployments.  

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5c
July 2, 2008
-- blockbuster now connects back to sidecar on launch or connections, allowing sidecar to know that blockbuster is alive, and allowing future communications such as current frame, fps, etc from blockbuster to user in sidecar

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5b
July 1, 2008 
-- sidecar can now exit blockbuster automatically and reliably
-- fixed various bugs relating to launch feature
-- various interface bugfixes and improvements


================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.5a
June 24, 2008 
-- user can now control blockbuster with keystrokes like space bar from sidecar without interacting with blockbuster
-- sidecar now knows how to launch blockbuster in both DMX and non-DMX modes

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.4a
June 19, 2008
-- Blockbuster no longer hangs when sidecar sends it cues in rapid succession
-- A stable release which supports MPI framesync seems worthy of a numerical change.  
-- new file format: cuefiles are now human readable and editable and more robust
-- socket communications are now simpler
-- user can set image position on canvas using sidecar

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.3f
May 16, 2008
-- Sidecar correctly saves and loads cuefiles now.  
-- Blockbuster no longer appears to crash when sidecar executes a cue.  
-- slaves launched without the -mpi batch flag no longer try to use MPI, which resulted in an error.  

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.3e
March 5, 2008

-- MPI framesync now works!  It's so smooth, it's like buttah. 
-- Slaves no longer get left around if blockbuster is killed with control-C or otherwise exits ungracefully.  


================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.3d
Feb 11, 2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- implemented "talkback" channel from slaves to masters as a platform for error handling in the future
-- fixed crash when viewing movies greater than 4GB
-- improved frame synchronization to ensure that no slave swaps buffers before all have finished the previous frame.  Still not good enough, but better than it was. 
-- Added LLNL auspices and disclaimer to sidecar code.
-- fixed crashing bugs when no file is selected at program start
-- added support for gprof and gcov.  Use GPROF=TRUE make to enable.  Might have to make clean in src/blockbuster to pick up the changes to makefiles. 
================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.3
Aug 30, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

July 27, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	  -- Blockbuster converts movie file names to full paths before processing. 
	  This prevents the backend nodes from getting confused by relative paths. 

================================================================================
VERSION 2.5.2
July 26, 2007
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed the following bugs: 
	  -- Blockbuster was crashing in DMX mode.  Found an uninitialized struct in
