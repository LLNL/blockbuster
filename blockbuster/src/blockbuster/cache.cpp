/* This file contains routines for manipulating the Image Cache.
 *
 * An Image Cache is a collection of images, both read from the
 * disk (i.e. full images) and as yet unread (i.e., frame
 * specifications).  The Image Cache abstraction allows for images
 * to be preloaded, loaded upon request, retrieved quickly if they're
 * already loaded, etc.
 *
 * This implementation expects to cache at most a few tens of images;
 * as such, complicated storage and sorting routines aren't necessary,
 * as the few images stored can be searched in very short time compared
 * to image display and image reading.  We'll stick with simple, basic,
 * linear list management.
