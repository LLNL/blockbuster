Threading is now the major obstacle to blockbuster performance.  I think the easiest way to proceed is a major rewrite, because the code is very creaky. 

My 8 week plan to rule the world.  7 Steps to rewrite blockbuster.

1)  write my own threadsafe getframe() function that can retrieve an image of any format and put it into a frame class (2 weeks)  DONE

2) display the frame into a window (1 week)  DONE

3) play a sequence of frames into the window and get timings for large movies. (1 week) 
   For langerGZ.sm, with blockbuster, I sometimes get 100-150 FPS using 85% of a CPU, and sometimes get 60 FPS using 45% of a CPU.  Could be thread timing issues?  
   OK -- the first pass completely serial, I get  51.6134 FPS using 85% of a CPU. Hmm WTF? 

4) make #4 threaded (1 week)

5) Clean up the code from 1-4 and take a breath. 

6) drop in the blockbuster GUI with "stop and play" functionality enabled (1 week)

7) Implement the rest of the GUI (1 week)

8) Add sidecar functionality (1 week)

Let's make this library more modern.  
The old library did not allow buffered I/O, a major flaw, and was complicated and not thread-safe.  The new design will allow all these things.
