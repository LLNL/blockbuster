# This file is to be included in the Mac and Linux installer tarballs.  

LINUX INSTALLATION: 
Run the install.sh script and give it an INSTALL_DIR, either through the environment variable INSTALL_DIR, via command line argument, or in response to the interactive prompt.  $INSTALL_DIR/bin/blockbuster and $INSTALL_DIR/bin/sidecar will be installed, along with libraries and documentation as needed.  

MAC INSTALLATION: 
Decompress install-blockbuster-mac.tgz and you will find blockbuster.dmg and sidecar.dmg.  Double click on them and drag the executables where you need to have them.
