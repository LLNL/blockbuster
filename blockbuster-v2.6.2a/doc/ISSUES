OLD NOTES:  
Note by Rich Cook:  Author:  Brian Paul?  (unknown)

1.  Image Format
    The current code also requires the File Format module to always return
    a 24-bit RGB stream.  The renderer may prefer a different stream.  Right
    now the renderer is required to change the format if necessary, which
    typically requires allocation of a new buffer, and is rather inefficient.

    Again, some file format modules (e.g. PNG) will not be able to efficiently
    convert to the desired format at runtime.

    Resolution:  Provide conversion utilities outside of either the File Format
    or Renderer modules.  The main program will ask the File Format module for
    the Renderer's desired format; if the File Format module returns a different
    format, the main program will handle the conversion.


2.  Varying-sized movies
    It's possible for multiple image files to be specified as a single movie,
    where the files have different dimensions.  Should smaller movies be
    centered?  In the upper-left corner?  Expanded to fill the screen?  Should
    overly-large movies be shrunk?  Centered?

    Resolution: Punt.  This is considered to be a corner case; any reasonable
    handling is acceptable.


3.  Text display in upper-left corner is always drawn in white.
    The font is harded coded in movie.h:  DEFAULT_X_FONT


4.  The initial window should not always appear at (0,0).  Like any X client,
    it should be placeable by the user with the mouse.
    Also, we should add a standard -geometry command line option.
