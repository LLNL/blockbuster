     IN 2007, Blockbuster 2.5 was released, which marked the addition of the Sidecar program to the blockbuster large movie toolkit.  Sidecar has two purposes.  First, it acts as a "remote control" for blockbuster, letting users control blockbuster running remotely, which moves the controls from a remote, hard to read screen to the local display. Second, it manages lists of "movie cues," such as loading, playing, resizing movies, that can be cued up in a list and executed during a demo with ease and reliability. 
  
        This quarter, the Blockbuster toolkit will be released at version 2.6.  This version adds new features and improvements to user interface, while increasing stability. Blockbuster is also now hosted on Sourceforge.net, a public code repository that might allow the project to gain some attention in other venues, such as video production houses, large businesses, or other national laboratories.  
     Examples of new features in version 2.6 are "session management," i.e., the ability to launch blockbuster remotely and report remote errors when something goes wrong, additional command line arguments to allow common operations to proceed speedily without needing the GUI at all, automatic detection and use of an existing DMX display, an automated system for using MPI to launch the blockbuster backend components under any system of MPI management, and many smaller feature requests such as the ability to capture the current frame to an image file.  
     The stability improvements are gained through the consistent use of better quality assurance practices in the development cycle, such as a test script and the use of bug tracking and user surveys.  
     The user interface for blockbuster itself has been transitioned from GTK to Trolltech Qt, which will enable faster deployment of GUI improvements and has already resulted in a completely consistent look and feel between blockbuster and sidecar.
