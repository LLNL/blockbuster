             libpnmrw.c - PBMPLUS read/write library
                       version of 11jan93
                    previous version 19may92

This library is a subset of the full PBMPLUS libraries.  All it does
is read and write PBM/PGM/PPM files.  The interface is almost identical
to the real libraries - the two differences are that pnm_init() turned
into pnm_init2 with different args, and that all the routines that can
fail return error statuses instead of exitting.

The intended use of this library is to make it easier for programs
to make use of PBMPLUS.  For instance, if you want to be able to
read in any type of image that PBMPLUS can handle, you could do a
popen("anytopnm file","r") and then read from the resulting file
pointer using these routines.

Most of the configuration options in full PBMPLUS have been removed.
There is still one in each of libpnmrw.h and libpnmrw.c, so you have
to edit both files before you compile.
