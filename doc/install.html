To check what version you are using, type "qmake -v".  If you don't have Qt installed, then you must download it and install it from source or binary from Trolltech's website.  I'll let you Google that.  :-)  If installing from source, I recommend the following configure line for a minimal build of Qt, to reduce the install time:   </p>		<p align="LEFT"> ./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR --fast --confirm-license --opensource -nomake  examples -nomake demos -nomake docs -nomake translations </p>		<p align="LEFT">We are not responsible if you muck any of this up and it overwrites some critical libraries or otherwise causes you injury. You do not need to be root to install this software, so the potential for harm is minimal, but if Bad Things happen, tough noogies! We warned you.   Do not hate on us.  </p>		<p align="LEFT"><br />				After you've download and unpacked the archive, do the following:</p>		<ol>			<li>				<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>cd blockbuster-2.5</b></p>			</li>			<li>				<p align="LEFT" style="margin-bottom: 0in">Examine/edit <b>Makefile </b>to set the <b>DMX</b> and <b>DEBUG</b> variables appropriately.  <strong>Important: BLOCKBUSTER DOES NOT BUILD WITH DMX BY DEFAULT -- YOU MUST SET DMX IN THE MAKEFILE TO BUILD WITH DMX SUPPORT! </strong></p>			</li>			<li>				<p align="LEFT">Optionally set the environment variable <b>INSTALL_DIR</b>. If you do not set INSTALL_DIR, it will be set to ./$SYS_TYPE, or if that is not defined, it will use ./$(uname -n), which on Linux machines is &quot;Linux&quot;.<b> </b>Directories $INSTALL_DIR, $INSTALL_DIR/bin, $INSTALL_DIR/man, $INSTALL_DIR/lib, and $INSTALL_DIR/include will be created if needed.</p>			</li>			<li>				<p>type  <b>make</b></p>			</li>			<li>				<p>When finished, the <b>blockbuster, sidecar, and *sm*</b> executables will be in the <b>$INSTALL_DIR/bin</b> directory, Man pages are installed in $SYS_TYPE/man. Some incidental libraries and headers are also installed in $INSTALL_DIR/lib and $INSTALL_DIR/include. This is a bug in the installer that will be fixed in the future, but it is harmless.</p>			</li>		</ol>	</body></html>
