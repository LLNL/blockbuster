My 8 week plan to rule the world.  7 Steps to rewrite blockbuster.

1)  write my own threadsafe getframe() function that can retrieve an image of any format and put it into a frame class (2 weeks)    

2) display the frame into a window (1 week)  DONE

3) play a sequence of frames into the window. (1 week)

4) make #4 threaded (1 week)

5) drop in the blockbuster GUI with "stop and play" functionality enabled (1 week)

6) Implement the rest of the GUI (1 week)

7) Add sidecar functionality (1 week)
